## HW2
  * Problem 1: Minimum Sub-Rectangle Problem
    * Description: In (n X n) integer array, the score of sub-rectangle is calculated as (sum of even numbers - sum of odd numbers). Find the maximum score in given (n X n) array.
  * Problem 2: Diversity of Operations
    * Description: For given 3-finite group, an operation is defined. The placement of parentheses would change the overall result of the expression. Find the number of placements in order to derive given output from given expression.
  * Problem 3: Palindrome
    * Description: For given string, find the maximum length of substring that is palindrome.
  * Problem 4: Playboard
    * Description: There is a game that is conducted on the (n X 3) integer array. By marking the symbols on the integer, the score is counted.  Find the maximal score that can be obtained from the given (n X 3) integer array.
  * Problem 5: Stacking a tower
    * Description: n blocks, with a groove on the top, is given. If two consecutive blocks are stacked, the height of stacked blocks is not sum of two height, but sum of height minus height of a groove. Otherwise, the height is just sum of two blocks' heights. In this case, for given blocks and integer, find the maximal heights of stacked blocks that is not greater than given integer.
